This project, firstly, was final task after some cources, which I had attended.

But I decided to pass it as 2nd lab of OOP Fundamentals course, because it has much patterns inside.

So there are them:

     ~App is designed corresponding to MVC template
  
     ~Main Servlet designed as Front-Controller
  
     ~Accessible functionality for USER and ADMIN designed using pattern COMMAND
  
    ~Database processes using JDBC and DAO pattern designed as FACTORY
  
     ~DB Manager class designed as SINGLETONE
  
    ~Application has Service layer to separate business logic and DB implemenation

    ~Filters implemetenting CHAIN pattern
  
Additional tasks, which are realized:

    ~40% tests coverage(JUnit + Mockito)
  
    ~Work with real Database
